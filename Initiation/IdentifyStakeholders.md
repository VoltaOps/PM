# Internal Stakeholders:
### 1 - 	Owner(s):
Those who identify themselves as the CEO and Current owner of the company is also identified as an internal stakeholder. This is due to Owners being liable for every issue the company goes through especially when they have a significant role in strategy.

##### 2 -	Manager(s):
Taking part in being the Manager of a Cooperation, Organization and/or Company places them under the title of internal stakeholders. This is due to them being able to take part in decision making that could affect other stakeholders. 

##### 3 -	Employee(s):
The Employee or Employees who partake in the Cooperation, Organization and/or Company are internal stakeholders. This is due to Employees having a significant financial and time investment into the project they are working on and putting effort into.

# External Stakeholders:

### 3 -	Government:
The Government is an external stakeholder of the company. Although it is not directly within the company itself, it still considered one of the major stakeholders by the sole reason of collecting taxes from three groups involved within the company. They collect from the company itself, also known as corporate income taxes, The Employees who work for the company also known as Payroll taxes and any other spending the company incurs also known as sales taxes.

### 4 -	Customers:
Customers are an external stakeholder due to the company following customer ideals for the product, or in this case the mobile application which provides them the offers. Customers focus on wanting the business to produce a perfect quality mobile application and provide them with proper offers to help them through their day.

### 5 -	Shareholder(s):
The shareholder is one of the companies most valuable assets. A shareholder could be considered anything from a human being to a company or even an institution which partakes in the company by purchasing a percentage of shares from them. Hence, the name “Shareholder”. This could consider them as either internal or external because if a shareholder owns more than 50% of shares of the company, they are considered the new primary decision maker and/or CEO/Owner.
